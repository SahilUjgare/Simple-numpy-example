âš¡ How It Works

Two Python lists and two NumPy arrays of equal size are created.

Both are multiplied element-wise:

Python lists â†’ using list comprehension with zip().

NumPy arrays â†’ using vectorized multiplication.

Execution time is measured for both methods and compared.

ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaways

Python lists are slower because operations run in pure Python loops.

NumPy arrays are much faster due to optimized C-based vectorized operations.

NumPy is the preferred choice for data science, machine learning, and numerical computations.


âœ¨ This project is a simple demonstration for beginners to understand why NumPy is used instead of Python lists for heavy numerical tasks.
